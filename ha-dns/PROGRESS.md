# HA DNS — Progress Log

> Append-only execution log. Newest entries at the top. Each entry records what was done, what's next, and any decisions/anomalies worth surfacing. Phases are defined in [`PHASES.md`](PHASES.md).
>
> Format: one entry per session of work, dated. Use UTC. Keep entries terse — this is the "what happened" record, not the "why" (which lives in BLUEPRINT.md).

## Status

**Current phase**: Pre-Phase 1 (design complete, awaiting dns-ha-agent v1.0)

**Blockers**: `dns-ha-agent` is unimplemented. See [`../dns-ha-agent/PHASES.md`](../dns-ha-agent/PHASES.md).
